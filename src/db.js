/**
 * SQLite connection with schema migrations applied on open. Every service subclasses this with its
 * own `static MIGRATIONS` (an ordered array of SQL blocks, one per schema version) — nothing else
 * changes, so an existing service's schema and migration content move here unmodified:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { Database as CoreDatabase } from '@atc-web/service-core/db';
 * export class Database extends CoreDatabase {
 *   static MIGRATIONS = [`CREATE TABLE ...`];
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `#migrate()` reads `MIGRATIONS` off the actual subclass (`this.constructor.MIGRATIONS`), so a
 * service that defines no migrations at all (there is none today, but the base class must not
 * assume one exists) simply gets an empty array via the default below. A fresh database (no prior
 * `user_version`) and an existing one being upgraded run through this exact same loop — there is no
 * separate "create" path.
 *
 * Migration tracking is deterministic and layered two ways: `PRAGMA user_version` is the fast-path
 * check (unchanged from before), and every applied migration also gets a row in `schema_migrations`
 * (`version INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, so a second attempt to record the same version is a constraint
 * violation, not silent). Each migration runs in its own `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`/`COMMIT`; a failure rolls
 * back that one migration and throws, leaving `user_version` at the last successfully applied
 * version — the service then fails to start rather than run against a half-migrated schema. Before
 * the first pending migration on a database that already has data (`user_version > 0`), the file is
 * snapshotted with `VACUUM INTO` to `<path>.pre-v<current>-<timestamp>-<pid>` (skipped for
 * `:memory:` and for a brand new database, since there is nothing to protect yet) — `VACUUM INTO`
 * takes its own consistent read snapshot, so it is safe under WAL with concurrent readers. If the
 * database's `user_version` is already ahead of what this build's `MIGRATIONS` supports, the
 * constructor throws `ConfigError` instead of touching anything — an old build must never run
 * against a newer schema.
 *
 * **Concurrent startup migration safety** (post-production Phase 1): two separate OS processes
 * (e.g. a split `<service>-api` + `<service>-worker` pair's simultaneous first start — see
 * `stack up --split-workers`) opening the SAME database file at the same instant, against a pending
 * migration, do not race the migration SQL itself. `#migrate()` acquires SQLite's write lock with
 * `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` — not a deferred `BEGIN` — before deciding whether a given version still needs
 * applying, and re-reads `PRAGMA user_version` fresh *after* the lock is held, not from a value
 * cached before any lock was acquired. A process that loses the race for a given version's lock
 * blocks until the winner's transaction commits, then discovers on its own fresh read that the
 * version it was about to apply is already there, and moves on without re-running that migration's
 * SQL. This makes the migration SQL's logical effect apply exactly once per version regardless of
 * how many processes raced to open the file, and the loser never crashes on a genuinely simultaneous
 * start. `VACUUM INTO` itself cannot run inside a transaction (verified empirically against
 * `node:sqlite`), so the pre-migration backup is *not* lock-serialized the way migration application
 * is — under a real race, more than one process may each take a (redundant but harmless, since
 * neither has migrated anything yet at that point) backup; every backup taken is always valid and
 * always represents the state strictly before any migration SQL in this open. See
 * `stack/docs/POST_PRODUCTION_PLAN.md` Phase 1 and `test/migration-race.test.js` for the full
 * reasoning and the real cross-process regression this guarantees.
 *
 * This guarantee is specifically about *this database file's own local startup migration*, opened
 * by processes on the *same host* through `node:sqlite`. It says nothing about network filesystems,
 * distributed databases, or normal (post-startup) multi-process runtime access beyond what each
 * service's own lease/heartbeat model already provides — see the "Compatibility/performance" note in
 * the Phase 1 report for the exact boundary of what changed.
 *
 * This class does not cache prepared statements — every service already had its own idiom for that
 * (either a fixed set of named statements prepared once, or an ad hoc `Map` for dynamic SQL) and
 * none of them turned out to share the same shape closely enough to be worth a generic cache class
 * here. One gotcha worth keeping regardless of who does the caching: never reuse a cached statement
 * for `.iterate()` — `StatementSync#iterate()` keeps cursor state on the statement object itself, so
 * two concurrent `.iterate()` calls sharing one cached statement reset each other's cursor (the bug
 * Stage 0 fixed in audit's `EventStore.iterate()`). Prepare a fresh statement per `.iterate()` call.
